# athletic_sales_analysis

Please find the code for this homework assignment here: [athletic_sales_analysis_starter_code.ipynb](https://github.com/mmccanse/athletic_sales_analysis/blob/main/athletic_sales_analysis_starter_code.ipynb)

In completing this assignment, I referenced class activities from this module and previous modules, class slide decks, and utilized a Chat GPT assistance prompt provided by the instructor to serve as a teaching assistant. 

Please note that the instructions provided in Canvas indicated that each time the data should be sorted, that it should be sorted in "ascending" order. However, it also said the data should show the "top 10 results", which is "descending" order. Additionally, all examples provided in Canvas showing how results should appear displayed descending order. As such, I completed all sorting in descending order.
